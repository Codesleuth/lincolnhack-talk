  - What can't hackbot do for me
    - Can't kick people from your team, so be careful who you add
    - Can't delete a team - you need to all leave your team and it will delete automatically
      - So try to get your team name right!
    - Can't give you tips
      - Hackbot barely knows what's going on. Don't even bother
    - Won't give you relationship advice (although I've heard Hackbot is a real sweetheart)
